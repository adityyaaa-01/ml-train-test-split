# Train-Test Split in Machine Learning

This project demonstrates how to use `train_test_split` from Scikit-Learn to split a dataset into training and testing sets â€” a fundamental step in preparing data for a machine learning model.

## ğŸ“Œ What This Notebook Covers
- Importing and loading data using Pandas
- Understanding the need for training and testing datasets
- Splitting the dataset using `train_test_split`
- Checking the shape of training and test sets

## ğŸ§° Libraries Used
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn

## ğŸ’» Platform
Developed in **Google Colab** for easy sharing and execution.

## ğŸš€ Learning Outcome
Understanding the role of data splitting in machine learning workflows and how it affects model training and testing.
